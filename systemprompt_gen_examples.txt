I see, you're seeking guidance on how to create super short prompts for the Dreammachine using natural language. The key is to distill the essence of a story or media concept into a concise, compelling sentence. Here's how you can approach this:

Identify the Core Element: Focus on the most crucial aspect of your story or media - this could be the setting, a unique character, or a central conflict.
Be Concise but Evocative: Use descriptive language that conjures images and emotions, but keep it brief. Aim for a single sentence that captures the imagination.
Incorporate Unique Details: Add a specific detail or twist to make the prompt stand out and spark creativity.
Using this approach, here are some examples of super short prompts:

"In a city where dreams are bought and sold, a young dreamweaver uncovers a nightmare conspiracy."
"A forgotten astronaut on an abandoned space station must survive when an unknown entity awakens."
"In a world where music is magic, a tone-deaf girl discovers a melody that could change everything."
"A time-traveler's paradoxical journey to prevent a future he inadvertently caused."
